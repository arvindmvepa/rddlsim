This file lists bugs and errors found in the final competition
domains.  These errata will *not* be fixed in order to keep a single
standard version of each domain that everyone can use and compare on
(including to IPPC 2011 final competition results).

Elevators Domain, from Alan Olsen:

It's not a problem, just makes the domain easier: passengers are able
to exit their elevators once they reach their destination whether the
doors are open or not (see elevators_pomdp.rddl lines 121 and 131).
The following lines should be changed from

   then KronDelta( ~exists_{?f : floor} [elevator-at-floor(?e, ?f) ^ TOP-FLOOR(?f)] )
...
   then KronDelta( ~exists_{?f : floor} [elevator-at-floor(?e, ?f) ^ BOTTOM-FLOOR(?f)] )

to

   then KronDelta( ~exists_{?f : floor} [elevator-at-floor(?e, ?f) ^ TOP-FLOOR(?f) ^ ~elevator-closed(?e)] )
...
   then KronDelta( ~exists_{?f : floor} [elevator-at-floor(?e, ?f) ^ BOTTOM-FLOOR(?f) ^ ~elevator-closed(?e)] )
