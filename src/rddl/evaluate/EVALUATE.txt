Both of the following should produce logs on recognized ports
- Need to run noop policy
- Need to run random policy
(Need a script so that these run on all competition instances)

Evaluator needs to read in a list of all competition instances
- Also needs to know number of trials
- Computes the min values from noop/random policies
- Needs to do evaluation for all competitors at same time to 
  compute max

Each instance maps to average reward and standard error of the mean (95%)

Also need to track a histogram of everyone who competed on each file, min, max scores
