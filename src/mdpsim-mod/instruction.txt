communicate with RDDL server with PPDDL mdpclient.
change the name of the file rddlclient.cc to client.cc
copy the files into mdpsim 
compile and run 

Here is the command I used for mdpclient
mdpclient --verbose=-1 --host=localhost --port=2323 --horizon=20 game_of_life_mdp.glm1.ppddl
What this command does is running a random client which reads a translated ppddl file and communicates with server that runs game_of_life_nointerm_mdp.rddl.

Note that I gave horizon as parameter, this may subject to change.
Also, I artificially parsed the action names like set__x1_y1 into set(x1,y1).
